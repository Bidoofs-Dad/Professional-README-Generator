# Professional README Generator!

## About The Application

Essentially what this application will do, is ask you a list of prompts about the repository you have created. After answering all the questions, it will then generate a quality README for you, that has been populated with the information that you have provided!

One extra part I threw into my code, was a spot that you will be able to edit in information for a screenshot for your application! (This is done after the README has generated, it is not one of the questions that is asked.)

## Issues

Fortunately I didn't run into too many issues with this application! It was pretty similar to the in class mini-project we had done before this assignment! That being said I did run into a couple obsticles along the way.

* The main issue I had was just trying to get the badges to work, they seemed so finicky and just didn't want to work. But eventually I was able to figure it out, and was able to provide that functionality!

* Piggybacking off the previous issue, the licenses was another hurdle to get over, since we haven't really learned anything about them. But, that issue too was taken care of in due time! I also plan to go back and add in more licenses in the future.

## Screenshots

I will provide a video of the working application below, followed by a couple screenshots!

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this wasn't my favorite project by any means, I am much more a fan of actually building web applications with HTML, CSS and JavaScript! That being said, even though I'm not a huge fan of node, it was still a good source of learning about how it can be used! I definitely look forward to learning some more tricks with it!
